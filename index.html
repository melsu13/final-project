        <h2>Let me show you around my kitchen!</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Since my first fried egg at the age of 9, I have used cooking as an outlet for creativity, fun, alone time, and so much more. Cooking has remained a constant in my life that I have been able to take advantage of in terms of doing something that makes both me and my tastebuds happy!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Please explore my site to see some of the favorite foods I have cooked in the past, and check out the recipes page for some links that I have used in the past for inspiration.
